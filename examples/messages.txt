We're no strangers to code,
You know the framework and so do I.
High availability's what I'm dreaming of,
You wouldn't get this uptime from any other node.

I just wanna tell you how I'm processing,
Gotta make you understand:

Never gonna crash your app,
Never gonna slow you down,
Never gonna run around and overload you.
Never gonna make you wait,
Never gonna break the gate,
Never gonna throw an error and block you.

We've processed requests for so long,
Your server's been aching but it's too robust to say it.
Inside, we both know what's been logged (been logged),
We know the stack and we're gonna scale it.

And if you ask me how I'm running,
Don't tell me you're too blind to see:

Never gonna crash your app,
Never gonna slow you down,
Never gonna run around and overload you.
Never gonna make you wait,
Never gonna break the gate,
Never gonna throw an error and block you.

Never gonna crash your app,
Never gonna slow you down,
Never gonna run around and overload you.
Never gonna make you wait,
Never gonna break the gate,
Never gonna throw an error and block you.

Ooh, we've processed requests for so long,
Your server's been aching but it's too robust to say it.
Inside, we both know what's been logged (been logged),
We know the stack and we're gonna scale it.

I just wanna tell you how I'm processing,
Gotta make you understand:

Never gonna crash your app,
Never gonna slow you down,
Never gonna run around and overload you.
Never gonna make you wait,
Never gonna break the gate,
Never gonna throw an error and block you.

Never gonna crash your app,
Never gonna slow you down,
Never gonna run around and overload you.
Never gonna make you wait,
Never gonna break the gate,
Never gonna throw an error and block you.

Never gonna crash your app,
Never gonna slow you down,
Never gonna run around and overload you.
Never gonna make you wait,
Never gonna say "Too late",
Never gonna throw an error and block you.
